Hi Zheng,

Sorry I have not been in communication. I have had to take care of many things with my mother’s estate and the business. I hope you are happy at your new job and starting to “fit in” and it feels more normal than new. I am leaving Wed. morning to go to Mexico for some need rest and relaxation with Dave. His arthritis has been causing him a lot of pain so I hope the warm weather helps. Then we are going from Mexico to LA to visit the family for Thanksgiving.

Tonight I have been cleaning out drawers and found 10,000 yuan. I cannot figure from the internet if it’s worth 1600 dollars or only 2-3. It is from 1944. Do you know if it worth anything? Please is you don’t maybe your dad will. I hope to speak with you soon. Also I went into the Tumi store. You should register your case in the event is is stolen they can sometimes track it or not sure about replacing. But you should register it just in case.

Hugs to my special friend.
